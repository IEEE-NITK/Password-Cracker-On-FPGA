# Password Cracker on FPGA
----------------

This repository contains a password cracker implemented in Verilog that performs a dictionary attack using various hashing algorithms. The project targets FPGA platforms and is designed to crack passwords in a fast and efficient manner.
----------------

## Features
- Supports SHA256.
- Dictionary attack approach to cracking passwords.

## Currently Under Progress:
-  MD4 and MD5 hash algorithms
- Implementation on an FPGA platform for maximum performance

## Requirements
- FPGA development board
- Verilog compiler (Vivado)
- Dictionary file containing possible passwords
